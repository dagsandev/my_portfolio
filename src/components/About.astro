          Experienced developer with over two years of expertise. My journey began

          technologies such as Spring, Hibernate, SQL and Docker, among others.

          Currently, I am focusing expanding my knowledge in frontend
          technologies, UX/UI design, and accessibility. Also I enjoy staying

          Software Development.
